* Uniorg Utility

This program converts your org-mode files into html + metadata.
Outputs to json.

** Usage:
   To run, paste into the command line.\\
   Outputs json by default.
   #+begin_src shell
     node main.js [IN-DIR] [OUT-DIR]
   #+end_src

   Add ~false~ to output files as edn.
   #+begin_src shell
     node main.js [IN-DIR] [OUT-DIR] false
   #+end_src

** Known issues:
 - If an org-document has the same id, it creates a single file, not sure what other undefined behavior it has.
 - If an org-document has no id field, I don't know what happens.

** To be implemented:
 - Make a command line interface. Currently just an API accessible via CLI.
 - Publish on NPM, so I can do ~npm install uniorg-util~ and ~uniorg-util [in-dir] [out-dir]~.
