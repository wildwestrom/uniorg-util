* Uniorg Utility

This program converts your org-mode files into html + metadata.
Outputs to json.

** Known issues:
 - If an org-document has the same id, it creates a single file, not sure what other undefined behavior it has.

** To be implemented:
 - Make a command line interface. Currently just an API accessible via CLI.
