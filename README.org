* Uniorg Utility

This program converts your org-mode files into html + metadata.\\
Outputs to both json and edn formats.

It relies heavily on [[https://github.com/rasendubi][rasendubi]]'s very accurate org-mode parser, *[[https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg][uniorg]]*.\\

** Usage:
   Outputs json by default.
   #+begin_src shell
   node main.js [OPTIONS]
   #+end_src

   By default it will process everything in the current directory.

   Options:
   #+begin_example
     -i, --input [DIR]      .      Directory to read from
     -o, --output [DIR]     .      Directory to output to
     -e, --edn                     Output files as edn instead of json
     -m, --manifest [NAME]  false  Create a list of all-files processed.
     -h, --help
   #+end_example

** Example:

*** Input:

   #+begin_src org
#+title: Here's a title
#+subtitle: And more headers
#+date: 2021-04-15
#+tags: it also has an id
#+author: Christian Westrom
#+id: test-1

* Here's some stuff
  :PROPERTIES:
  :id: Here's a drawer of stuff
  :END:
  * Here's more stuff

    Note: Formatted nicely just for show.\\
    Outputs as one line.

         :date              "2021-04-15",
         :tags              "it also has an id",
         :author            "Christian Westrom",
         :id                "test-1",
         :original-filename "100-test"}}
