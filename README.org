* Uniorg Utility

This program converts your org-mode files into html + metadata.\\
Outputs to both json and edn formats.

It relies heavily on [[https://github.com/rasendubi][rasendubi]]'s very accurate org-mode parser, *[[https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg][uniorg]]*.\\

** Usage:
   To run, paste into the command line.\\
   Outputs json by default.
   #+begin_src shell
     node main.js [IN-DIR] [OUT-DIR]
   #+end_src

   Add ~false~ to output files as edn.
   #+begin_src shell
     node main.js [IN-DIR] [OUT-DIR] false
   #+end_src

** TODO Known issues:
*** TODO If an org-document has the same fields or filenames, it creates a single file.
    Not sure what other undefined behavior it has.

** TODO Features to be implemented:
*** TODO Figure out CI/CD.
    This project should test before committing or accepting pull requests.\\
    This project should also build, test, and deploy to npm on commit.
*** TODO Make into a polished command line tool.
    Currently just an API accessible via CLI.
*** TODO Publish on NPM,
    I'd like to just do ~npm install uniorg-util~ and ~uniorg-util [in-dir] [out-dir]~.
